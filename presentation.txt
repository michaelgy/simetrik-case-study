Simetrik Case Study - Remediation Agent
=====================================

1. Project Overview
------------------
The Simetrik Remediation Agent is an automated system designed to handle transaction remediation requests through multiple communication channels. It processes transaction files, manages communication history, and maintains transaction states in a structured manner.

2. Technologies Used
-------------------
- Python 3.8+
- Flask (Web Framework)
- Google Cloud Services:
  * Gmail API
  * Google Drive API
  * Google Sheets API
- WhatsApp Business API (Wasender)
- Docker (Containerization)
- LangChain & Gemini (AI/ML)

3. Design Patterns
-----------------
1. Clean Architecture:
   - Domain Layer: Core business logic and entities
   - Application Layer: Use cases and business rules
   - Infrastructure Layer: External services integration

2. Repository Pattern:
   - Abstracts data access
   - Provides consistent interface for data operations
   - Example: GoogleSheetsService implementation

3. Factory Pattern:
   - Service creation and configuration
   - Blueprint creation for Flask routes

4. Observer Pattern:
   - WhatsApp message queue system
   - Event-driven communication handling

5. Strategy Pattern:
   - Different communication strategies (Email/WhatsApp)
   - Multiple file processing strategies

4. Key Features
--------------
1. File Processing:
   - XLSX file parsing
   - Transaction validation
   - Automatic categorization

2. Communication:
   - Email automation
   - WhatsApp messaging
   - Message queue system
   - Communication history tracking

3. State Management:
   - Transaction state tracking
   - Remediation status monitoring
   - History logging

4. Integration:
   - Google Services integration
   - WhatsApp API integration
   - REST API endpoints

5. Tools and Utilities
---------------------
1. Development Tools:
   - Git (Version Control)
   - Docker (Containerization)
   - VS Code/PyCharm (IDE)

2. Testing Tools:
   - Python unittest
   - Test scripts for each component
   - Integration tests

3. Monitoring Tools:
   - Logging system
   - Error tracking
   - Performance monitoring

6. Project Structure
-------------------
1. src/
   - application/: API handlers and business logic
   - domain/: Core business entities and types
   - infrastructure/: External service integrations
   - main.py: Application entry point

2. tests/
   - Component-specific test files
   - Integration tests
   - Test utilities

3. env/
   - Environment configuration
   - Service account credentials

7. Future Improvements
---------------------
1. Enhanced Error Handling:
   - More robust error recovery
   - Better error reporting

2. Performance Optimization:
   - Caching mechanisms
   - Batch processing

3. Additional Features:
   - More communication channels
   - Advanced analytics
   - Machine learning integration

4. Security Enhancements:
   - Enhanced authentication
   - Better encryption
   - Audit logging

8. Conclusion
------------
